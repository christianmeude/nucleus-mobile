# [COMPLETED] NUcleus Mobile — Implementation Plan: UI Overhaul

> **STATUS: COMPLETED** — All phases (1–10) complete. Branch `feat/ui-overhaul` ready to merge into `dev`.
> *This plan describes a UI-only overhaul of the NUcleus Mobile React Native Expo app on branch `feat/ui-overhaul`. It re-grounds every visible surface in the brand identity and the design system defined in [docs/PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md](../PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md), without touching the data layer, navigation contracts, or domain types. The Supabase migration is fully complete and stable; the data path is frozen for the duration of this work.*

**Canonical product context:** [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](../PROJECT_CONTEXT.md)

**Primary design reference:** [PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md](../PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md)

**Migration history (do not reopen):** [SUPABASE_MIGRATION.md](./SUPABASE_MIGRATION.md)

---

## 1. Constraints (must hold for every phase)

- **Do not touch the data layer.** [src/api/research.ts](../../src/api/research.ts), [src/api/notifications.ts](../../src/api/notifications.ts), [src/api/invitations.ts](../../src/api/invitations.ts), [src/context/AuthContext.tsx](../../src/context/AuthContext.tsx), [src/lib/supabase.ts](../../src/lib/supabase.ts), [src/auth/fetchAppUserProfile.ts](../../src/auth/fetchAppUserProfile.ts), [src/auth/mapSupabaseAuthError.ts](../../src/auth/mapSupabaseAuthError.ts), and [src/storage/authStorage.ts](../../src/storage/authStorage.ts) are frozen.
- **Do not change domain shapes.** [src/types/domain.ts](../../src/types/domain.ts) is frozen.
- **Do not rename or restructure navigation.** [src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx](../../src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx) and [src/navigation/types.ts](../../src/navigation/types.ts) keep their route names, route params, tab order, and gating logic. Visual styling of the navigator (tab bar, header) is the only navigator-level change permitted.
- **Do not modify** [docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](../PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) **or** [docs/PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md](../PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md).
- **Brand palette is the anchor.** Colors are derived directly from the official NUcleus logo and the roadmap's color system; no off-brand colors are introduced.
- **No new product scope.** The roadmap's "Future Enhancements" (§6) are explicitly out of scope for this overhaul, except for the items that read as polish/accessibility (contrast, dynamic type, reduced motion, micro-interactions). Reading-mode redesign, night mode, in-app PDF viewer, long-press quick actions, and inline annotations are out of scope.
- **Run** `npx tsc --noEmit` **after every code change.** A green typecheck is part of every phase's exit criteria.
- **Commits are not part of this plan.** Commit messages and merge mechanics are handled separately.

## 2. Brand and design foundation (anchor)

The brand identity is fixed by the official NUcleus logo and is the source of all primary design tokens. The roadmap's [§2 Design System](../PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md#2-design-system) governs how these tokens are applied.

### 2.1 Palette (from the logo)

> **Working values, pending brand confirmation.** The hex values below are the agreed starting points and are subject to fine-tuning at any point during the overhaul. They are not locked. If a confirmed brand swatch arrives mid-phase, the change is a single edit in `src/theme/colors.ts` and propagates everywhere automatically — that propagation is the whole purpose of Phase 1.

- **Primary navy** — the deep blue of the "N" letterform. Working value: `#1B3A8C`. Used for primary CTAs, navigation emphasis, brand surfaces, and links per roadmap §2 ("blue family for primary UI elements, navigation, and links").
- **Royal blue (mid-tone)** — the lighter blue segment of the orbital swoosh. Used for hover/pressed/active states and decorative gradient stops on brand-only surfaces. Working value: `#2E5BC9` (`palette.navy[400]`), pending brand confirmation and subject to fine-tuning.
- **Accent gold** — the warm amber/gold of the orbital swoosh and orb. Working value: `#F5A623`. Reserved per roadmap §2 for "highlights, micro-interactions, and important affordances (actions, status badges)" — never decorative.
- **Neutrals** — clean whites for primary surfaces, soft cool-grays for secondary surfaces and dividers, slate ink for body and headings. Maps directly to roadmap §2 "Neutrals".

### 2.2 Typography (decisions, mapped to roadmap §2)

- **Primary UI font: Outfit** (humanist sans), loaded via `expo-font`. Used for **all** UI surfaces: tab bar, headers, screen titles, section headings, body copy, metadata, buttons, chips, badges, form labels, and inputs. Outfit carries the entire UI vocabulary.
- **Display / accent font: Lora** (serif), loaded via `expo-font`. Used **sparingly** for premium typographic treatments where content is the focus: the paper title in `ResearchDetail` and any other reading-focused surfaces. This realizes roadmap §2's note that a serif may be considered "for printed-style titling in premium views."
- **Lora is never used for UI chrome** — no Lora in the tab bar, navigation headers, buttons, chips, form labels, metadata, or list-row titles. Outfit owns those surfaces. Lora's job is editorial weight, not interface text.
- **Designerly balance.** Outfit and Lora pair on a small number of surfaces — primarily `ResearchDetail`'s reading view, where the title is Lora and everything around it (status chip, metadata, action buttons, abstract section header) stays Outfit. The intent is that Lora reads as content and Outfit reads as the application around it.
- **Type scale.** Strong scale across display, h1, h2, h3, body, bodyStrong, metadata, caption — tuned for mobile reading per roadmap §2 ("strong scale between headings, subheads, body, and metadata; line lengths and sizes tuned for mobile reading"). Left-aligned body copy; consistent metadata sizing.
- **Loading.** Both fonts are registered via `expo-font` in [App.tsx](../../App.tsx) and gated behind a single splash/loading state so the app never paints before the type system is ready. The existing `FullScreenLoader` pattern is the model.

### 2.3 Surface and motion rules (from roadmap §2 + §3)

- Soft elevation via gentle shadows; no heavy borders.
- Subtle glass/translucent surfaces only for transient overlays (modals, bottom sheets).
- Short-duration easing for reveal/hide; no long or attention-grabbing animations.
- **Animation runtime: React Native core only.** Motion is implemented with `Animated`, `LayoutAnimation`, and `Pressable` feedback. **`react-native-reanimated` is excluded for this overhaul.** It may be revisited in Phase 9 if a specific native-feel interaction proves limiting under core APIs; that revisit is a scoped exception, not a default.
- **Phase 9:** Durations for skeleton pulse and list entrance animations are centralized in [src/theme/motion.ts](../../src/theme/motion.ts) and exposed as `theme.motion`. Reduced motion is detected via [src/hooks/useReduceMotion.ts](../../src/hooks/useReduceMotion.ts) (not direct `AccessibilityInfo` calls outside that hook).

### 2.4 Orbital motif

The orbital arc is a brand element and informs subtle decorative or motion details (active-tab indicator, splash/loader pulse, login mark). It is never used as primary content chrome.

### 3.2 Preserve vs replace

| Preserve | Replace / refactor |
|----------|---------------------|
| Route names, route params, tab order in [src/navigation/types.ts](../../src/navigation/types.ts) | Inline `StyleSheet` literals and hard-coded hex values in every screen |
| Data fetching, RLS contracts, error semantics from `src/api/*` | Ad-hoc loading text, ad-hoc empty states, ad-hoc error strings — replaced by shared components |
| Domain shapes in [src/types/domain.ts](../../src/types/domain.ts) | Hard-coded chrome colors in tab bar / headers — replaced by themed navigator config |
| `AuthContext` API surface and `signIn` / `signOut` behavior | Logout placement and styling inside `DashboardScreen` (visual only; `signOut()` call is unchanged) |

---

## 4. Note on Login and UnsupportedRole

The user's per-screen scope is explicitly the six listed screens (Dashboard, MyPapers, Browse, Notifications, Invitations, ResearchDetail). [src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx](../../src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx) and [src/screens/auth/UnsupportedRoleScreen.tsx](../../src/screens/auth/UnsupportedRoleScreen.tsx) are not first-class overhaul phases. They are migrated to the new tokens and primitives as part of Phase 2 (Component System) so that no screen is left on legacy chrome, but they receive no bespoke layout redesign in this plan. Reviewers can promote them to a dedicated phase if desired.

---

## 5. Phased plan

Each phase declares scope, what is explicitly **not** changing, exit criteria, and a status field. Current state: Phases 1–9 are complete; Phase 10 is not started.

### Phase 1 — Design system foundation

✅ **COMPLETED (stable)**

**Implementation summary**

- ✅ Created [src/theme/colors.ts](../../src/theme/colors.ts), [src/theme/typography.ts](../../src/theme/typography.ts), [src/theme/spacing.ts](../../src/theme/spacing.ts), [src/theme/shadows.ts](../../src/theme/shadows.ts), and [src/theme/index.ts](../../src/theme/index.ts) as the Phase 1 design-token foundation.
- ✅ Delivered fonts via `@expo-google-fonts/outfit` and `@expo-google-fonts/lora` using `npx expo install` instead of raw TTF files, with the same runtime result and zero manual font file management.
- ✅ Registered Outfit + Lora in [App.tsx](../../App.tsx) and gated app render behind `fontsReady`.
- ✅ Mounted `AuthProvider` inside the `fontsReady` branch so auth UI did not render before typography was ready.
- ✅ Tightened font-weight typing to `NonNullable<TextStyle['fontWeight']>` to resolve a strict-mode typing issue.
- ✅ Resolved the royal blue working mid-tone to `palette.navy[400] = #2E5BC9` (still subject to fine-tuning).
- ⏳ Deferred `useTheme()`/provider and `src/theme/motion.ts` to later phases and documented the deferment in this plan.

**Implementation decisions**

- Font packaging used Expo Google Fonts modules (`@expo-google-fonts/*`) rather than manually checked-in TTF assets.
- Theme consumption in this phase remained direct (`import { theme } from 'src/theme'`) without context boilerplate.
- Deferred token/provider work was intentionally split so Phase 1 only delivered the approved foundational scope.

**Exit criteria met:**

- ✅ The five Phase 1 theme files existed and exported typed tokens.
- ✅ Outfit and Lora loaded correctly before app UI rendered.
- ✅ `npx tsc --noEmit` — green.
- ✅ No screen, navigation, data-layer, or domain-type files were changed.

---

### Phase 2 — Component system

✅ **COMPLETED (stable)**

**Implementation summary**

- ✅ Added [src/theme/radii.ts](../../src/theme/radii.ts) with `sm / md / lg / pill` tokens and exported it through [src/theme/index.ts](../../src/theme/index.ts).
- ✅ Created UI primitives in `src/components/ui/`: [Surface.tsx](../../src/components/ui/Surface.tsx), [Card.tsx](../../src/components/ui/Card.tsx), [Button.tsx](../../src/components/ui/Button.tsx), [Chip.tsx](../../src/components/ui/Chip.tsx), [Badge.tsx](../../src/components/ui/Badge.tsx), [Stat.tsx](../../src/components/ui/Stat.tsx), [IconButton.tsx](../../src/components/ui/IconButton.tsx), [EmptyState.tsx](../../src/components/ui/EmptyState.tsx), [Skeleton.tsx](../../src/components/ui/Skeleton.tsx), [InlineNotice.tsx](../../src/components/ui/InlineNotice.tsx), [BottomSheet.tsx](../../src/components/ui/BottomSheet.tsx), [Divider.tsx](../../src/components/ui/Divider.tsx), [Logo.tsx](../../src/components/ui/Logo.tsx), [OrbitalAccent.tsx](../../src/components/ui/OrbitalAccent.tsx), and [index.ts](../../src/components/ui/index.ts).
- ✅ Built feature components in `src/components/`: [ResearchCard.tsx](../../src/components/ResearchCard.tsx), [NotificationCard.tsx](../../src/components/NotificationCard.tsx), [InvitationCard.tsx](../../src/components/InvitationCard.tsx), [PaperStatusChip.tsx](../../src/components/PaperStatusChip.tsx).
- ✅ Centralized duplicated status sets in [PaperStatusChip.tsx](../../src/components/PaperStatusChip.tsx): `ACTIVE_STATUSES`, `ACTION_STATUSES`, and `PUBLISHED_STATUSES`.
- ✅ Re-skinned [src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx](../../src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx) with theme-driven tab bar/stack header styles, plus a subtle active-tab gold dot accent and a `Logo`-based `FullScreenLoader`.
- ✅ Migrated auth surfaces to tokenized styling and shared primitives in [src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx](../../src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx) and [src/screens/auth/UnsupportedRoleScreen.tsx](../../src/screens/auth/UnsupportedRoleScreen.tsx) without behavior or copy changes.
- ✅ Kept tab screens and `ResearchDetailScreen` untouched per scope.

**Implementation decisions**

- `useTheme()` or context was not introduced. All new work consumed tokens through direct imports from `src/theme` (`import { theme } from '../theme'` or path-equivalent), per the Phase 2 correction.
- `Logo` and `OrbitalAccent` were implemented as static React Native composition because no SVG dependency was present in the project dependency tree.
- `BottomSheet` was implemented with native RN `Modal` and `Pressable` only; no extra dependency was added.
- The optional gold active-tab accent was kept because it reads subtle and consistent with the orbital motif.

**Exit criteria met:**

- ✅ All Phase 2 primitives and feature components were created with TypeScript types and consumed tokens via direct `theme` imports.
- ✅ Tab bar and stack header read colors/typography from theme tokens.
- ✅ `LoginScreen` and `UnsupportedRoleScreen` were migrated to tokens + shared `Button` without layout redesign, copy changes, or behavior changes.
- ✅ `npx tsc --noEmit` — green.
- ✅ Data layer, domain types, route names/params/tab order, tab screens, and `ResearchDetailScreen` were not modified.

---

### Phase 3 — Dashboard overhaul

✅ **COMPLETED (stable)**

**Implementation summary**

- ✅ Re-implemented [src/screens/main/DashboardScreen.tsx](../../src/screens/main/DashboardScreen.tsx) on design-system primitives and theme tokens with no hex literals.
- ✅ Replaced the legacy in-screen header copy with the approved greeting: `Welcome back, {firstName}.` with `Welcome back.` fallback when `firstName` is unavailable.
- ✅ Replaced `LogoutButton` with `IconButton` in the in-screen header row while preserving the `signOut()` call from `useAuth()` unchanged.
- ✅ Replaced local `StatCard` blocks with `Stat` primitives and kept the existing `stats` memo and count logic unchanged.
- ✅ Switched status-set usage to centralized imports from [src/components/PaperStatusChip.tsx](../../src/components/PaperStatusChip.tsx): `ACTIVE_STATUSES`, `ACTION_STATUSES`, `PUBLISHED_STATUSES`.
- ✅ Replaced recent-paper rows with [ResearchCard.tsx](../../src/components/ResearchCard.tsx) and preserved `ResearchDetail` navigation behavior.
- ✅ Replaced bare loading and empty text states with `Skeleton` and `EmptyState`.
- ✅ Replaced bare error text with `InlineNotice` and themed the `RefreshControl` (`tintColor` + `colors`) from `theme`.
- ✅ Extended [src/components/ui/Stat.tsx](../../src/components/ui/Stat.tsx) with a backwards-compatible `tone?: 'default' | 'warning'` prop so "Needs Action" can map to semantic warning tokens.
- ✅ Post-commit label consistency correction: Dashboard stats now show `Approved` (was `Published`) and `Revision Required` (was `Needs Action`) to match Phase 4 terminology.

**Implementation decisions**

- Logout stayed in the in-screen header row (not navigator `headerRight`) so Dashboard structure remained local and no navigator contracts were touched.
- `firstName` was derived from `user.fullName` because the domain user shape exposes `fullName` only; fallback behavior is applied when parsing yields no usable token.
- `loadData`, `useFocusEffect`, `recentPapers` memo, `stats` memo, `researchApi.getMyPapers`, and `ResearchDetail` routing were preserved exactly as required.

**Exit criteria met:**

- ✅ `DashboardScreen` now consumes theme tokens and shared primitives (`Stat`, `ResearchCard`, `EmptyState`, `Skeleton`, `IconButton`, `InlineNotice`) with no hex literals.
- ✅ Logout continues to sign out through the same `signOut()` path.
- ✅ `npx tsc --noEmit` — green.
- ✅ Required behavior remains unchanged: stats computation, recent-paper navigation, and pull-to-refresh flow.

---

### Phase 4 — MyPapers overhaul

✅ **COMPLETED (stable)**

**Implementation summary**

- ✅ Re-implemented [src/screens/main/MyPapersScreen.tsx](../../src/screens/main/MyPapersScreen.tsx) with design-system tokens and primitives and removed all hex literals.
- ✅ Replaced the bare `TextInput` with a themed search wrapper containing a leading search icon and a clear affordance (`Chip` labeled `Clear`) that resets `query`.
- ✅ Replaced local filter pills with `Chip` primitives for `All`, `In Review`, `Published`, and `Needs Action`, keeping `activeFilter` semantics unchanged.
- ✅ Replaced inlined status-set definitions with centralized imports from [src/components/PaperStatusChip.tsx](../../src/components/PaperStatusChip.tsx): `ACTIVE_STATUSES`, `ACTION_STATUSES`, and `PUBLISHED_STATUSES`.
- ✅ Replaced bare paper rows with [ResearchCard.tsx](../../src/components/ResearchCard.tsx) while preserving navigation to `ResearchDetail`.
- ✅ Replaced bare loading and empty states with `Skeleton` and `EmptyState`.
- ✅ Replaced bare error text with `InlineNotice`.
- ✅ Themed `RefreshControl` using `theme.colors.brand.primary`.
- ✅ Applied pre-commit presentational corrections: filter labels updated to `Approved` and `Revision Required`, `PaperStatusChip` tone mapping refined (`approved/published` green, `revision_required` warning, `rejected` danger), and `ResearchCard` view/download counts now render only for `approved`/`published` statuses via centralized `PUBLISHED_STATUSES`.

**Implementation decisions**

- `isFilterMatch`, free-text search targeting (`title + abstract + keywords`), and descending `paperDate` sort order were kept functionally identical and only re-skinned.
- `EmptyState` icon was passed as a rendered `<Ionicons />` node to avoid the string-as-child runtime issue fixed in Phase 3.
- The clear affordance was implemented as a compact `Chip` to stay within existing primitives without introducing new component surface area.

**Exit criteria met:**

- ✅ `MyPapersScreen` now uses theme + shared primitives (`Chip`, `ResearchCard`, `Skeleton`, `EmptyState`, `InlineNotice`) with no hex literals.
- ✅ `researchApi.getMyPapers`, `loadData`, `useFocusEffect`, `isFilterMatch`, search behavior, sort order, and `ResearchDetail` navigation remained unchanged.
- ✅ `npx tsc --noEmit` — green.
- ✅ Filter toggling, search-within-filter behavior, pull-to-refresh, and row navigation pathways were preserved.

---

### Phase 5 — Browse overhaul

✅ **COMPLETED (stable)**

**Implementation summary**

- ✅ Re-implemented [src/screens/main/BrowseScreen.tsx](../../src/screens/main/BrowseScreen.tsx) on design-system tokens and primitives with no hex literals.
- ✅ Updated Browse header copy from the earlier `Repository` draft to the finalized in-app `Browse` title with no subtitle.
- ✅ Replaced the bare search field with a themed search row (leading search icon, clear `Chip`) aligned with Dashboard/MyPapers.
- ✅ Replaced horizontal category pills with `Chip` primitives, including the leading `All categories` chip.
- ✅ Replaced list rows with [ResearchCard.tsx](../../src/components/ResearchCard.tsx) using `showEngagementCounts` so view/download counts appear only on Browse.
- ✅ Extended `ResearchCard` with an optional `categoryLine` prop so Browse can keep the existing `resolveCategoryName` + `UUID_PATTERN` category-resolution path and the prior `Category: …` row copy without changing filter logic.
- ✅ Replaced bare loading and empty states with `Skeleton` and `EmptyState` (`EmptyState` icon passed as rendered `<Ionicons />`).
- ✅ Replaced bare error text with `InlineNotice` and themed `RefreshControl` (`tintColor` + `colors`).
- ✅ Applied pre-commit shared-card polish: `ResearchCard` now supports `showStatusChip` (Browse passes `false`), optional `keywords` chips (capped at four, horizontal), category text above title, icon-based engagement counts, and a compact author avatar initial; Browse also uses contextual empty-state copy (`No results for \"{query}\"` vs category fallback).

**Implementation decisions**

- `loadData`, `useFocusEffect`, `filtered` memo (category filter + free-text search + sort), `UUID_PATTERN`, `resolveCategoryName`, and `ResearchDetail` navigation were preserved; only layout and styling changed.
- `ResearchCard`’s `categoryLine` is optional and unused by Dashboard/MyPapers so other tabs stay unchanged.

**Exit criteria met:**

- ✅ `BrowseScreen` uses theme + `Chip` + `ResearchCard` + `Skeleton` + `EmptyState` + `InlineNotice` with no hex literals.
- ✅ Browse is the only screen passing `showEngagementCounts` on `ResearchCard`.
- ✅ `npx tsc --noEmit` — green.
- ✅ Category chips, search, sort, refresh, and row navigation behavior match the pre-overhaul semantics.

---

### Phase 6 — Notifications overhaul

✅ **COMPLETED (stable)**

**Implementation summary**

- ✅ Re-implemented [src/screens/main/NotificationsScreen.tsx](../../src/screens/main/NotificationsScreen.tsx) on design-system tokens and primitives with no hex literals.
- ✅ Header uses themed `h1` title plus an unread count line (`{unreadCount} unread`) and a `Button` `subtle` variant for "Mark all read", disabled when `unreadCount === 0`, with an explicit `accessibilityLabel`.
- ✅ Replaced inlined rows with [NotificationCard.tsx](../../src/components/NotificationCard.tsx); unread rows use the existing `Badge` (accent gold via `theme.colors.brand.accent`) plus title weight/color distinction for accessibility.
- ✅ Applied a soft unread row treatment by passing `theme.colors.brand.primarySurface` as the `PressableCard` `style` background when unread (tonal surface tint per plan, replacing the legacy hard navy border on the old screen).
- ✅ Replaced bare loading and empty text with `Skeleton` and `EmptyState` (`EmptyState` icon passed as rendered `<Ionicons />`).
- ✅ Replaced bare error text with `InlineNotice` and themed `RefreshControl` (`tintColor` + `colors`) consistent with Dashboard/Browse.

**Implementation decisions**

- `NotificationCard`’s public props (`notification`, `onPress`) matched the screen contract with no interface changes; the unread surface tint was added inside the card so list rows stay encapsulated.
- Empty-state body copy uses a short supporting line under the prior "No notifications yet" intent so `EmptyState` has both `title` and `message` like other overhauled tabs.

**Explicitly NOT changing**

- `notificationsApi.getMine`, `markRead`, `markAllRead` are unchanged.
- `openNotification` flow (mark read, then navigate to `ResearchDetail` if `research_id` exists) is unchanged.
- Pessimistic vs optimistic state update ordering is unchanged.

**Exit criteria met:**

- ✅ `NotificationsScreen` contains no hex literals; uses theme + primitives + `NotificationCard` (which renders `Badge` for unread).
- ✅ Read/unread visuals pair gold `Badge` with title emphasis and unread surface tint (not color alone).
- ✅ `npx tsc --noEmit` — green.
- ✅ Manual smoke (expected): opening a notification marks it read; "Mark all read" works; navigation to `ResearchDetail` from notifications works.

---

### Phase 7 — Invitations overhaul

✅ **COMPLETED (stable)**

**Implementation summary**

- ✅ Re-implemented [src/screens/main/InvitationsScreen.tsx](../../src/screens/main/InvitationsScreen.tsx) on design-system tokens and primitives with no hex literals.
- ✅ Replaced inlined invitation rows with [InvitationCard.tsx](../../src/components/InvitationCard.tsx) (`acting` boolean, Accept `primary` / Decline `secondary` unchanged inside the card). An interim three-`Stat` summary row was removed in post–Phase 7 refinements in favor of a pending-count subtitle (see below).
- ✅ Replaced bare loading and empty text with `Skeleton` and `EmptyState` (`EmptyState` icon passed as rendered `<Ionicons />`).
- ✅ Replaced bare error text with `InlineNotice` and themed `RefreshControl` (`tintColor` + `colors`) consistent with Notifications.
- ✅ For calendar-expired **pending** invitations, the screen passes a display-only invitation object with `status: 'expired'` into `InvitationCard` so status presentation and action visibility match the legacy screen (no Accept/Decline) without mutating list state or `counts` (still derived from API rows).

**Post–Phase 7 refinements (Invitation UX)**

- ✅ [InvitationCard.tsx](../../src/components/InvitationCard.tsx): removed `PaperStatusChip`; status is shown as a **row with a 7×7 dot** (`dotColorForStatus`: gold / green / red / muted / subtle fallback, preserved for future reuse) plus a **metadata-styled label** (`Pending`, `Accepted`, `Declined`, `Expired`, or first-letter–capitalized fallback).
- ✅ [InvitationCard.tsx](../../src/components/InvitationCard.tsx): **metadata order** — title → status dot row → `Invited by:` → `Invited:` + `created_at` when defined (all statuses) → `Expires:` for `pending` only → `Expired:` for `expired` only; **non-`pending` cards** use a single inner wrapper at **`opacity: 0.5`** so action rows stay unchanged when shown.
- ✅ Further refinement: **removed the left border accent** on `Card` (no `style` override on `Card`; no `accentColorForStatus` / border width constants).
- ✅ [InvitationsScreen.tsx](../../src/screens/main/InvitationsScreen.tsx): removed the three **`Stat`** summary row; added a **subtitle** under the screen title driven by `counts.pending` (`1 pending invitation` / `{n} pending invitations` / `No pending invitations`), styled like `NotificationsScreen` (`bodySmall`, `text.secondary`, `marginTop: spacing.xs`).

**Implementation decisions**

- `InvitationCard` only gates actions on `invitation.status === 'pending'`, so expired-by-date rows that still arrive as `pending` from the API need a screen-level display override; handlers are omitted when `!canAct` for clarity.
- Decline confirmation `BottomSheet` remains deferred (optional in the plan); Accept/Decline stay one-tap per prior low-friction scope.
- Empty-state title preserves the prior single-line intent (`No invitations available`) with a short supporting `message`.

**Explicitly NOT changing**

- `invitationsApi.getMine`, `accept(token)`, `decline(token)` are unchanged.
- `runAction` flow (set acting token → call API → reload → clear acting token) is unchanged.
- The `isExpired` heuristic is unchanged.
- The `counts` memo grouping (`pending` / `accepted` / `closed`) is unchanged.

**Exit criteria met:**

- ✅ `InvitationsScreen` contains no hex literals; uses theme + primitives + `InvitationCard` (status dot + label, conditional date lines, muted non-pending cards; summary stats row removed in favor of a pending-count subtitle).
- ✅ Accept and decline still persist via the same API paths and list reload; acting row gates button disabled state.
- ✅ `npx tsc --noEmit` — green.
- ✅ Manual smoke (expected): accept/decline update data and UI; expired pending rows show no actions and an expired status presentation.

---

### Phase 8 — ResearchDetail overhaul

✅ **COMPLETED (stable)**

**Implementation summary**

- ✅ Re-implemented [src/screens/main/ResearchDetailScreen.tsx](../../src/screens/main/ResearchDetailScreen.tsx) on design-system tokens/primitives with no hex literals.
- ✅ Added `listCoAuthorNames(paper)` to [src/utils/format.ts](../../src/utils/format.ts) as a new helper only (existing helpers unchanged) and switched the detail metadata from co-author count to co-author name list (`None` fallback).
- ✅ Replaced legacy loading and missing-paper surfaces: loading now uses themed `ActivityIndicator` + themed text; missing-paper state now uses `EmptyState` with a rendered `<Ionicons />` icon.
- ✅ Applied Lora only to the paper title (`theme.typography.display` + `theme.fontFamilies.display.semibold`); all surrounding metadata, status, actions, abstract, and workflow remain Outfit tokens.
- ✅ Reworked metadata hierarchy: `PaperStatusChip`, author, co-authors, conditional department, published date, views, and downloads; added a keywords section with neutral `Chip` tags (hidden when no keywords).
- ✅ Replaced action `Pressable`s with `Button` primitives (`Open PDF` primary + loading; `Download` secondary) and moved error display to `InlineNotice` below actions.
- ✅ Added owner-aware workflow visibility (`showWorkflow`) using `useAuth().user` and `structured_authors`; workflow entries render as `Card` components with `padding="sm"` and a themed left border accent.
- ✅ Workflow empty state now uses a lightweight muted inline text message instead of bare body copy.

**Implementation decisions**

- `openFile` behavior and ordering were preserved exactly: track view → optional track download → resolve file URL → open browser; server-side download rejection still surfaces through the same error path.
- The owner check uses `structured_authors` primary entry matching `user?.id`, and workflow visibility follows the approved condition: always for non-approved/non-published, plus approved/published when owner.
- Keywords use `Chip` with `variant="status"` and `tone="neutral"` to keep them lightweight and non-interactive.

**Explicitly NOT changing**

- `researchApi.getResearchById`, `trackView`, `trackDownload`, `getResearchFile` calls are unchanged.
- Open-flow ordering (track view → optional track download → resolve URL → `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync`) is unchanged.
- Download gating semantics (`allow_download` failure surfaces as a user-facing error) are unchanged.
- `route.params.paperId` consumption is unchanged.
- No in-app PDF viewer is introduced (out of scope per §1).

**Exit criteria met:**

- ✅ `ResearchDetailScreen` contains no hex literals; uses theme + primitives + `PaperStatusChip`.
- ✅ Title, metadata, abstract, keywords, actions, and workflow hierarchy now map to roadmap §4.3 with Lora used only for the title.
- ✅ Open/download flows and error surfacing remain behaviorally unchanged.
- ✅ `npx tsc --noEmit` — green.

---

### Phase 9 — Polish and accessibility

✅ **COMPLETED (stable)**

**Implementation summary**

- ✅ Added [src/theme/motion.ts](../../src/theme/motion.ts) and `theme.motion` in [src/theme/index.ts](../../src/theme/index.ts); skeleton + list entrance durations read only from `theme.motion`.
- ✅ [src/hooks/useReduceMotion.ts](../../src/hooks/useReduceMotion.ts) centralizes `AccessibilityInfo` subscription; used by [Skeleton.tsx](../../src/components/ui/Skeleton.tsx) and [ListEntranceItem.tsx](../../src/components/ListEntranceItem.tsx).
- ✅ Skeleton pulse (`Animated.loop` / `sequence`, `0.4`↔`1.0`, `theme.motion.skeletonCycleDuration`); static `opacity: 0.6` when reduce motion.
- ✅ [ListEntranceItem.tsx](../../src/components/ListEntranceItem.tsx): staggered fade + slide on Dashboard, MyPapers, Browse, Notifications, Invitations lists only; not on `ResearchDetailScreen`.
- ✅ Press scale `0.98` on [PressableCard](../../src/components/ui/Card.tsx), [Button](../../src/components/ui/Button.tsx), [IconButton](../../src/components/ui/IconButton.tsx), filter [Chip](../../src/components/ui/Chip.tsx).
- ✅ Card/search a11y: `ResearchCard`, `NotificationCard`, `InvitationCard` labels; Browse/MyPapers `TextInput` `accessibilityLabel="Search papers"` + hints; filter chips `accessibilityState.selected`.
- ✅ [typography.ts](../../src/theme/typography.ts): `scaledFontSize` in `make()` for all `fontSize` only (cap `1.3`, line heights fixed).
- ✅ Filter `Chip` touch target `minHeight` / `minWidth` **44**.
- ✅ Contrast: `colors.state.success` **#059669 → #047857**; `colors.state.danger` **#DC2626 → #B91C1C**; other audited pairs unchanged where already passing or not used as small body text on that surface.
- ✅ **§9.0:** Custom `ResearchDetail`-only stack header ([ResearchDetailHeader.tsx](../../src/navigation/ResearchDetailHeader.tsx)) with `useSafeAreaInsets().top`; wired in [AppNavigator.tsx](../../src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx). Typed stack options (`header`, `headerStyle`, `contentStyle`, `statusBar*` / `navigationBar*`, etc.) had no safer single-option fix for edge-to-edge header overlap. Verify on Android Expo Go / emulator.
- ✅ [format.ts](../../src/utils/format.ts): `STATUS_LABELS` adds `accepted`, `declined`, `expired` for `statusToLabel`.
- ✅ **Refinement:** Retuned list entrance cadence in [src/theme/motion.ts](../../src/theme/motion.ts) (`listItemDuration` **320**, `listStaggerDelay` **60**) and switched list-item timing to `Easing.out(Easing.cubic)` in [ListEntranceItem.tsx](../../src/components/ListEntranceItem.tsx).
- ✅ **Refinement:** Removed Android entrance shadow ghost by suppressing `ResearchCard` elevation while a row is entering (`useListEntranceActive` + `theme.shadows.level0` during animation, restoring `theme.shadows.level2` after completion).
- ✅ **Refinement:** [ResearchDetailScreen.tsx](../../src/screens/main/ResearchDetailScreen.tsx) now uses a compact metadata strip (author avatar/name, engagement stats, relative-date row with absolute-date label, optional department pill, expandable co-author chip when names exist).
- ✅ **Refinement (Issue #8):** Removed `Download` UI path from `ResearchDetailScreen` and the local `trackDownload` call-site; `Open PDF` remains, with view tracking preserved and a note that download is intentionally hidden pending `allow_download`.

**Original plan bullets (reference):**

- **Micro-interactions and motion** — add short-duration press feedback on `Pressable`s (scale or opacity), card mount transitions for first paint of lists, and a subtle accent on the active tab. All durations sourced from `theme.motion`. **Implementation uses RN core only (`Animated`, `LayoutAnimation`, `Pressable`)**; `react-native-reanimated` stays out of the dependency tree for this overhaul. If a specific interaction proves limiting under core APIs during this phase, it is logged as a scoped exception with rationale — not adopted as a default.
- **Reduced motion** — gate animation effects via `useReduceMotion` (which listens to the platform reduce-motion setting) and provide a static fallback (no animation, instant state change).
- **Contrast** — audit every `text on surface` and `text on brand` pairing to meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large text). Adjust token values if any pair fails.
- **Dynamic type** — replace fixed `fontSize` with a scale-aware helper that reads `PixelRatio.getFontScale()` and applies a sane upper cap so layouts do not break at maximum text size.
- **Touch targets** — verify every interactive element meets 44pt minimum.
- **Screen-reader labels** — add `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityRole` on icon-only buttons (logout, mark-all-read, accept/decline, action chips) and on cards that act as links to detail screens.
- **Status semantics** — confirm status chips communicate state via more than color alone (icon, label, or weight) to support color-deficient users.
- **Loading and empty states** — final pass to ensure every screen surfaces feedback within ~150ms (skeletons render immediately, not on a delay).
- **Performance perception** — confirm skeletons and empty states do not cause layout shift on first data arrival.

**Explicitly NOT changing (still holds)**

- No data-layer file is touched.
- No new feature is added.
- No navigation **contracts** (route names, params, tab order, gating).
- No change to copy beyond the small student-facing rewrites already noted in earlier phases.

**Exit criteria met**

- Manual a11y pass remains recommended on device (TalkBack / VoiceOver).
- Reduced-motion mode disables Phase 9 animations via `useReduceMotion`.
- Dynamic type scaling applied at typography token level (`scaledFontSize` cap).
- Contrast adjustments recorded in implementation summary above.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — green.

### Phase 10 — Validation and merge

✅ **COMPLETED (stable)**

**What changed and why**

Final guardrail before merging `feat/ui-overhaul` into `dev`. No new code was written in this phase except trivial fixes uncovered during validation.

**Validation outcomes**

- ✅ Static validation pass: frozen-layer diff `git diff origin/dev..feat/ui-overhaul -- src/api src/context/AuthContext.tsx src/lib/supabase.ts src/auth src/storage src/types src/navigation/types.ts` returned empty.
- ✅ `npx tsc --noEmit` — green.
- ✅ On-device smoke test against the 11 items below — all passing.
- ✅ Item 7 wording aligned with Issue #8 mitigation (Download UI removed; Open PDF tracks views only).

Smoke-test checklist (must pass on a real device or emulator):

1. **Cold start and session restore** — app boots through `FullScreenLoader`, lands on `Dashboard` for a known-good student account, and the stored session restores without re-prompting credentials.
2. **Login and sign-out** — fresh sign-in works; sign-out from Dashboard returns to `Login` and clears the visible session.
3. **Unsupported role** — non-student account lands on `UnsupportedRoleScreen` with a working sign-out.
4. **Browse** — list loads, search filters results, category chips filter results, refresh control works, tapping a card opens `ResearchDetail`.
5. **MyPapers** — list loads, all four filters work, search filters within the active filter, refresh works, tap opens detail.
6. **Dashboard** — stats compute correctly, recent papers list opens detail, logout works.
7. **ResearchDetail** — opens from each entry point (Dashboard recents, MyPapers row, Browse row, Notification with `research_id`), abstract and workflow render, "Open PDF" opens the file and increments view count after refresh.
8. **Notifications** — list loads, unread count is correct, opening a notification marks it read and navigates to detail when applicable, "Mark all read" clears unread state across the list.
9. **Invitations** — list loads, counts are correct, accept persists and removes pending state, decline persists and removes pending state, expired pending invitations show as expired and have no action buttons.
10. **Accessibility spot checks** — TalkBack/VoiceOver on `Login`, `Dashboard`, `MyPapers`, `ResearchDetail`, and `Invitations`. Reduced-motion toggle disables animations.
11. **TypeScript** — `npx tsc --noEmit` is green from a fresh checkout.

**Exit criteria**

- All 11 items above pass.
- No file under `src/api/`, `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`, `src/lib/supabase.ts`, `src/auth/*`, `src/storage/authStorage.ts`, or `src/types/domain.ts` was modified during this overhaul (verified with `git diff dev..feat/ui-overhaul -- src/api src/context/AuthContext.tsx src/lib/supabase.ts src/auth src/storage src/types`; this command must produce no output).
- No file under `src/navigation/types.ts` was modified, and `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` changes are styling-only (verified by inspection).
- Branch is ready to merge to `dev`.

## 6. Validation strategy (applies to every phase)

After **each phase**:

1. **TypeScript:** `npx tsc --noEmit`. A green typecheck is non-negotiable before moving on.
2. **Manual smoke:** the relevant subset of the Phase 10 checklist, focused on the screens or layers touched in the current phase. Earlier phases run the smaller subset (e.g., Phase 1 only requires the app to boot); later phases run progressively more.
3. **Visual regression sweep:** every screen previously overhauled is opened to confirm no token rename or component change broke its layout.
4. **Read-only diff guard:** `git diff dev..feat/ui-overhaul -- src/api src/context/AuthContext.tsx src/lib/supabase.ts src/auth src/storage src/types src/navigation/types.ts` must produce no output across the entire branch.

---

## 7. Non-goals (explicit)

- No new feature scope. The roadmap §6 items beyond polish/accessibility — enhanced reading mode, adjustable reading width, night mode, richer inline workflow timelines beyond the basic redesign in Phase 8, in-app PDF viewer, long-press quick actions, inline annotations — are out of scope.
- **No `react-native-reanimated` dependency.** Motion is implemented with React Native core animation APIs. Reanimated may be revisited in Phase 9 if a specific native-feel interaction cannot be expressed cleanly under core APIs; that revisit is a scoped exception, not a default.
- No data-layer changes. Supabase facades, RLS, RPCs, storage paths, and audit-row inserts are frozen.
- No domain shape changes. [src/types/domain.ts](../../src/types/domain.ts) is frozen.
- No navigation contract changes. Route names, route params, tab order, and gating logic are frozen.
- No copy overhaul beyond the small student-facing rewrites of two developer-flavored subtitles in Phases 3 and 5. These rewrites are approved as working values and may still be fine-tuned.
- No localization or i18n work.
- No analytics or telemetry instrumentation.
- No authentication flow changes (forgot password, register, deep-link handling).
- No commit-message conventions or merge mechanics — those are handled separately.

## 9. Success criteria (project level)

- Every visible surface of the app reads as institutionally branded NUcleus, anchored in the logo's navy and gold and in the roadmap's design system.
- Every screen consumes the design tokens and component primitives; no hex literal remains in any screen file.
- Navigation, data, and domain contracts are byte-identical to `dev` at merge time except for the styling-only changes inside [src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx](../../src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx).
- `npx tsc --noEmit` is green.
- The Phase 10 smoke checklist passes end-to-end on a real device.
- [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](../PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) and [PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md](../PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md) remain unchanged and remain accurate descriptions of the app.
